# SearchEngine
We need a data structure to organizes websites, where a website is defined by a structured collection of webpages that reside at the same host.
You need to implement a class Element modeling either directories or webpages and a class WebSite that saves a website. Furthermore, you have to implement a simplified model of a search engine, that allows users to retrieve relevant information from the collected Web Pages, by identifying pages containing a given keyword.
